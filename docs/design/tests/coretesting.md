# Core Testing Matrix

## Purpose

This document defines the target test matrix for the `core` module.
It mirrors the structure of the other testing docs in `docs/design/tests`, but
is tailored to the refactored core boundary:

- `core/domain` is tested as the pure domain model
- `core/application` is tested as orchestration and projection
- `core/ports` is tested as contract surface

The goal is not to test implementation accidents. The goal is to lock in the
behavioral contract of the core after the workspace and analysis refactors.

The suite is intentionally family-based: where a rule applies to all entities,
all collections, or all port boundaries, the test should describe that family
instead of a single incidental example.

## Scope

Included in this matrix:
- `core/include/core/domain/*`
- `core/src/domain/*`
- `core/include/core/application/*`
- `core/src/application/*`
- `core/include/core/ports/*`

Out of scope:
- `ui` behavior tests
- persistence schema and SQLite repository behavior
- infra adapters such as OCR, PDF, image processing, archive handling

## Testing Principles

- Domain tests should validate invariants, behavior, and aggregate ownership.
- Application tests should validate orchestration, projections, and workflow
  boundaries.
- Port tests should validate contract shape and boundary semantics.
- Prefer behavior families over one-off examples when the same rule applies to
  actors, properties, contracts, statements, transactions, analyses, or annuals.
- Tests should stay close to the public API, not private helper internals.
- If a test needs a large fixture, prefer a reusable helper builder over a giant
  inline setup block.

## Implementation Order

1. Domain entities and policies.
2. `WorkspaceCatalog` aggregate behavior.
3. Workspace command and workflow application services.
4. Snapshot projection and port contracts.
5. Analysis application behavior.

## Definition of Done

The core test suite is complete when:

- every domain entity has at least one focused behavior file
- every value object has a validation or normalization test
- every policy has a dedicated contract test file
- the workspace catalog aggregate is covered as an aggregate root
- the workspace application boundary is covered by snapshot, workflow, and port tests
- analysis has execution coverage through the application service and related domain rules
- the port contracts are locked with boundary-level tests
