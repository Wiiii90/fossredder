# Persistence Testing Matrix

## Purpose

This document defines the target persistence test matrix for the `persistence`
module.

It follows the same format as the other test design documents in
`docs/design/tests`: a short introduction, a concrete target tree, and then
behavioral matrices that describe observable contracts rather than
implementation details.

The persistence layer is responsible for SQLite schema lifecycle, registry
storage, repository round-trips, relation-table fidelity, and the workspace
state store.

The matrix is family-based. If the same persistence rule applies to actors,
properties, contracts, statements, transactions, analyses, annuals, drafts, or
logs, the tests should exercise that family consistently instead of checking a
single narrow example.

The current schema target is a single clean `v1` schema for fresh workspace
databases. It includes the relation tables needed by statements, drafts, logs,
and analysis adjustments so new databases start with the complete structure the
application now expects.

## Scope

Included in this matrix:
- `persistence/src/SqliteDb.cpp`
- `persistence/src/SqliteSchema.cpp`
- `persistence/src/SqliteTransaction.cpp`
- `persistence/src/SqliteRegistry.cpp`
- `persistence/src/Factory.cpp`
- `persistence/src/repositories/*`
- `persistence/src/WorkspaceStateStore.cpp`
- `persistence/include/persistence/*`

Out of scope:
- `ui` behavior tests
- `core/domain` invariants and policy behavior
- OCR, PDF, image, archive, or other infra-adapter behavior

## Persistence Boundary Model

The persistence module should persist and restore the application workspace
state through the repository layer and the workspace state store.

Relevant boundary types:
- `core/domain/catalog/WorkspaceCatalog` for catalog entities
- `core/application/workspace/WorkspaceSessionState` for the mutable session
  snapshot
- `core/application/import/draft/StatementDraft` and
  `core/application/import/draft/TransactionDraft` for import workflow state
- `core/application/import/ImportLog` and `core/application/export/ExportLog`
  for workflow run metadata

The persistence layer should not become a UI projection source.

## Testing Principles

- Use temporary file-backed SQLite databases.
- Verify base rows and relation tables together.
- Keep update behavior explicit for relation tables that are rewritten.
- Prefer deterministic ordering checks for relation vectors.
- Verify deletion impact through the workspace store, not through ad-hoc
  assumptions.
- Use one repository family per test file.

### Repository contract rules

- Use one repository family per fixture.
- Prefer temporary file-backed SQLite instead of mocks.
- Always verify both the base row and relation-table side effects.
- Explicitly test ordering for relation vectors.
- Include at least one round-trip test per repository family.

## Workspace State Orchestration

### Behavioral matrix

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WSS-001 | Save empty session state to fresh DB | Integration | Temporary database | Call `save(emptyState)` | Save succeeds and database remains valid |
| WSS-002 | Load from empty DB returns empty session state | Integration | Fresh database | Call `load()` | All collections are empty |
| WSS-003 | Full session round-trips | Integration | State with catalog, drafts, logs, and relation-backed statements | Call `save(state)` then `load()` | Loaded state matches the saved state, including statement transaction ids and analysis adjustments |
| WSS-004 | Deleted actor is reported in deletion impact | Integration | Persisted state with actor, then remove actor from new snapshot | Call `save(newState)` | Removed actor id is reported |
| WSS-005 | Deleted statement is reported in deletion impact | Integration | Persisted state with statement, then remove statement from new snapshot | Call `save(newState)` | Removed statement id is reported |
| WSS-006 | Cascaded transaction deletion is suppressed when statement is removed | Integration | Persisted statement and transaction | Remove only the statement in new snapshot | Transaction is removed by cascade and not double-counted |
| WSS-007 | Removed standalone transaction is reported | Integration | Persisted transaction not tied to removed statement | Remove transaction from snapshot | Removed transaction id is reported |
| WSS-008 | Analysis removal updates annual references | Integration | Annuals reference an analysis | Remove analysis from snapshot | Annuals remain and no longer reference the deleted analysis |
| WSS-009 | Contract removal keeps unrelated transactions stable | Integration | Transactions reference a contract | Remove contract from snapshot | Contract is removed and transactions survive with nullable FK behavior |
| WSS-010 | Draft removal cleans nested draft rows | Integration | Statement draft contains transaction drafts | Remove statement draft from snapshot | Draft and dependent transactions are removed together |
| WSS-011 | Save is transactional on failure | Integration | Inject a failing write path or schema violation | Call `save(state)` | No partial state is committed |
| WSS-012 | Load after save preserves relation topology | Integration | State with relation tables populated | Save and reload | Relation ids, aliases, timestamps, statement transaction links, and analysis adjustments remain consistent |

### Workspace store rules

- Deletion planning must stay deterministic.
- Statement deletions must not double-report transaction cascades.
- Analysis deletions must clean annual references.
- Statement transaction relations are synchronized from the saved catalog so the relation table stays consistent across round-trips.
- Repository failures must not leave partial state behind.

### Recommended state-store tests

| ID | Test case | Focus | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| WSS-U-001 | `save_emptyState_succeeds` | baseline | Guards against regressions in the transaction wrapper |
| WSS-U-002 | `save_reportsRemovedEntities` | deletion impact | Verifies deterministic deletion reporting |
| WSS-U-003 | `save_preservesCascadedTransactionDeletionPolicy` | dependency rule | Protects the statement-to-transaction suppression logic |
| WSS-U-004 | `load_afterSave_roundTripsAggregate` | parity | Verifies full aggregate round-trip |

## Cross-Cutting Parity Checks

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PAR-001 | All repository families support deterministic round-trip behavior | Contract | One sample entity per repository | Save and load each repository | The same entity shape survives round-trip |
| PAR-002 | All relation tables preserve ordering | Integration | Relation vectors with multiple ids | Save and reload | Order matches insertion order or documented ordering rule |
| PAR-003 | All clear operations remove side tables too | Integration | Repository with related rows | Call `clear...()` | Base rows and relation rows disappear together |
| PAR-004 | All repositories are tolerant of empty ids in read APIs | Contract | Empty string input | Call `getById("")` | Returns empty or none rather than throwing |
| PAR-005 | All repository constructors reject null DB handles | Unit | Null `SqliteDb` pointer | Construct repository | Exception is thrown |

## Practical Priorities

1. Keep the schema and helper tests green.
2. Keep one contract test file per repository family.
3. Keep relation-table round-trips explicit.
4. Keep workspace save/load tests focused on deletion impact and topology.
5. Extend the schema only when the actual repository contract needs it.
