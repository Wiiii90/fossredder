# UI QML Testing Matrix

## Purpose

This document defines the stable QML-level test matrix for the refactored UI.
It covers user-visible behavior at the QML boundary and stays aligned with the
root UI target architecture in `ui_architecture_target.md`.

The matrices below document the implemented QML surface and should remain
stable across internal source refactors as long as observable behavior stays
the same.

The suite is intentionally family-based: when a visible rule applies to every
entity editor, every sidebar, or every common control, the test should express
that reusable behavior instead of a one-off scene.

## Scope

Included in this matrix:
- `ui/tests/qml/*`
- QML components under `ui/qml/FossRedder/*`

Out of scope:
- C++ source-layer behavior
- `core` domain and application behavior
- persistence and infrastructure adapters
- visual styling changes that do not affect observable behavior

## Testing Principles

- Test the observable QML behavior, not the C++ implementation details behind
  it.
- Keep test ids stable so the matrix remains useful when the UI internals move.
- Prefer matrix-prefixed QML test function names so the code stays easy to cross-reference with the table rows.
- Use the smallest realistic QML harness or fake app context that can express
  the interaction.
- Prefer boundary wiring tests over layout pixel tests unless layout behavior is
  the point of the test.
- Keep QML tests separate from source-layer tests so each suite owns a single
  responsibility.
- Prefer repeated behavior families over bespoke one-screen-only assertions
  unless the screen is truly a unique edge case.
- For list-backed views, include a revision-driven refresh assertion so derived
  models rebind when the workspace data changes.
