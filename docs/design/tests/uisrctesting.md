# UI Source Testing Matrix

## Purpose

This document defines the current target test matrix for the `ui/src` C++
surface.

It mirrors the refactored UI boundary and keeps the source tests aligned with
the real code in `ui/tests`. The goal is to lock in the behavior of the UI
bridge layer:

- workspace facade and selection wiring
- session state and derived collections
- row projection and selection helpers
- mutation normalization helpers
- neutral navigation state
- thin adapter smoke checks
- small workflow smoke checks

The matrix is intentionally family-based. When the same rule applies to all
workspace collections, selection helpers, or row projection helpers, the test
should describe that family instead of a single incidental screen-specific
example.

## Scope

Included in this matrix:
- `ui/tests/unit/*`
- `ui/tests/interaction/*`
- `ui/tests/support/*`
- the source layer in `ui/include/ui/*` and `ui/src/*` that these tests cover

Out of scope:
- QML rendering and visual layout
- `core` domain and application behavior
- persistence and infrastructure adapters

## Testing Principles

- Source tests should validate observable behavior, not private helper details.
- Workspace tests should verify projection, selection, and boundary routing.
- Session tests should verify that collections stay consistent across refresh
  and deletion impact.
- Projection refresh tests should verify that derived rows rebind when the
  workspace revision changes.
- Row projection tests should verify stable ids, stable ordering, and stable
  selection behavior across all workspace families.
- Ordered selection projection should expose a flat row contract for QML:
  `rows`, `orderIds`, `index`, `id`, and `currentId` should stay in sync with
  the nested `selection` payload.
- Adapter smoke tests should keep the payload surface and mapper headers
  usable, even when the implementation remains intentionally thin.
- Workflow smoke tests should keep the import and export boundaries usable
  without coupling the source tests to QML rendering.
- Prefer family-based assertions over screen-specific one-off cases when the
  same rule applies to multiple collections.

## 1. Workspace Boundary

`WorkspaceFacade` is the UI-facing entry point for workspace projection,
selection access, and core-boundary mutation routing.

### Behavioral matrix

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WSP-001 | Workspace projection loads all catalog families | Unit | Facade with a representative workspace catalog | Load the catalog into the facade | Actor, property, contract, statement, transaction, analysis, and annual rows are all available |
| WSP-002 | Selection accessors resolve current workspace rows | Unit | Facade with a representative workspace catalog | Set actor, property, contract, statement, transaction, analysis, and annual selection ids | The selected rows resolve to the expected objects |
| WSP-003 | Statement transaction ids stay readable through the facade | Unit | Facade with a representative statement | Query statement transaction ids | The facade returns the current ordered transaction id list |
| WSP-004 | Workspace path changes propagate through the boundary | Unit | Facade wired to a storage manager stub | Create or open a workspace path | The facade and storage manager agree on the current path |
| WSP-005 | Mutations route through the core boundary and refresh rows | Unit | Facade wired to a writable core boundary | Add and delete actors | The actor row model updates deterministically after each mutation |
| WSP-006 | Workspace revision changes rebind derived row projections | Unit | Facade with a representative workspace catalog and a visible derived row consumer | Mutate the workspace and bump the revision | Statement, transaction, and other derived collection bindings re-evaluate deterministically |
| WSP-007 | Startup rehydrates persisted workspace families into UI models | Unit | Facade attached to a loaded workspace session state with workflow logs | Open the workspace and refresh the facade state | Booking, analysis, import, and export rows are restored from persisted state without dropping relations |
| WSP-008 | Analysis update preserves calc adjustments | Unit | Facade attached to a workspace with an analysis containing calculation adjustments | Update analysis metadata with and without an explicit adjustments payload | Existing adjustments survive metadata-only updates, and explicit adjustment payloads replace the core analysis adjustments |

### Boundary checks

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WSP-C-001 | Workspace facade stays the public workspace entry point | Contract | UI workspace headers available | Review public API | The facade exposes workspace behavior without reintroducing old controller classes |
| WSP-C-002 | Workspace projection stays source-side | Contract | Workspace source files available | Review include graph | Projection helpers remain in the UI source layer and do not leak into core |

## 2. Session State

`SessionModels`, `SessionSelection`, `SelectionState`, `NavigationState`, and
`SessionMutationState` keep the UI workspace state deterministic. View-specific
state wrappers such as `BookingState` own deterministic screen behavior that is
too stateful for declarative QML.

### Behavioral matrix

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |

| BKG-ST-001 | Booking create commit | Unit | Fresh workspace and BookingState draft | Fill statement and transaction fields and submit | A statement and transaction are created, selection moves to the created statement, and amount/status/allocatable values persist |
| BKG-ST-002 | Booking empty default transaction | Unit | Fresh workspace and BookingState draft with only statement name | Submit the statement | The statement is created without committing the empty default transaction draft |
| BKG-ST-003 | Booking incomplete transaction guard | Unit | Fresh workspace and BookingState draft with a statement name and incomplete transaction content | Attempt submit | Create remains disabled and no statement or transaction is committed |

| BKG-ST-008 | Booking incompatible actor cleanup | Unit | BookingState draft with a contract selected | Select an actor outside the selected contract | The actor id changes and the incompatible contract id is cleared |
| BKG-ST-009 | Booking incompatible property cleanup | Unit | BookingState draft with a contract selected | Select a property outside the selected contract | The property selection changes and the incompatible contract id is cleared |
| BKG-ST-010 | Booking edit update | Unit | Loaded statement and transaction selected | Change statement name and transaction fields, then update | Statement and transaction mutations persist and dirty state clears |

| ANL-ST-002 | Analysis create with calc adjustments | Unit | AnalysisState in create mode with preview transactions and all filters selected | Select an adjustment transaction, enter a localized percent value, apply calc, and create | The new analysis persists adjustments, stores all-selection config filters as unfiltered, and the initial preview render uses the adjusted values |
| ANL-ST-003 | Analysis update preserves stored calc amounts | Unit | AnalysisState loaded with an existing analysis containing stored calculation adjustments | Update analysis metadata in edit mode | Existing adjustment amounts remain unchanged in the core snapshot and pending UI state |
| ANL-ST-004 | Analysis filter unassigned options | Unit | AnalysisState in create mode with workspace choices loaded | Inspect property and contract-type filter choices, then trigger the unassigned-only shortcuts | Both filter lists expose explicit unassigned choices and the shortcut selections keep the UI state deterministic |
| ANN-ST-001 | Annual state loads selected annual | Unit | AnnualState loaded with a selected annual and analysis rows | Refresh from selection | Form fields, assigned/available analysis rows, and derived transaction sections reflect the annual |
| ANN-ST-002 | Annual assignment preview and update | Unit | AnnualState loaded with one assigned and one available analysis | Add the available analysis and submit update | The preview updates, dirty state is set, and the annual persists both analysis ids |
| ANN-ST-003 | Annual create commit | Unit | AnnualState in create mode with analysis rows | Enter name/year, assign an analysis, and create | A new annual is persisted and selected through the workspace facade |
| ANN-ST-004 | Annual export format routing | Unit | AnnualState with an assigned plot analysis | Change the export format | The analysis update is routed through the workspace facade and dirty state reflects the annual metadata change |

### Boundary checks

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| ADP-003 | Analysis payload mapper header stays usable | Unit | Mapper header available | Include the mapper header | The adapter remains a valid build-time contract surface |
| ADP-004 | Import suggestion mapper header stays usable | Unit | Mapper header available | Include the mapper header | The adapter remains a valid build-time contract surface |
| ADP-005 | Analysis preview returns filtered transactions from the current workspace snapshot | Unit | Analysis workflow with a representative workspace catalog | Request a preview for an empty filter and for a matching filter expression | The preview returns the visible transactions, the count metrics, and the row payloads stay aligned with the workspace snapshot |
| ADP-006 | Analysis filter composition defaults to the previous year and skips unrestricted groups | Unit | Analysis workflow with UI filter inputs and settings defaults | Build a filter from an unconfigured year selector and from all-selected property and contract groups | The canonical filter uses the previous year as default, keeps the year mode as the default case, and omits property and contract clauses when the selection is unrestricted |
| ADP-007 | Analysis filter composition keeps explicit partial selections intact | Unit | Analysis workflow with UI filter inputs | Build a filter from a partial property selection, a partial contract selection, and an explicit allocatable mode | The canonical filter preserves the explicit clauses and remains stable for preview and execution |

### Boundary checks

| ID | Scope | Layer | Setup | Action | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| IMP-W-010 | Actor quick-create selection helper updates current transaction state | Unit | Import workflow with a draft and actor row provider | Create/select actor for current draft via workflow helper | Current transaction actor id/text/selection flags update deterministically and draft refresh is requested |
| IMP-W-011 | Contract selection helper clears incompatible actor and property overrides | Unit | Import workflow with selected contract and existing manual actor/property selection | Select a contract row for current transaction | Contract id is set and dependent actor/property fields are normalized for consistency |
