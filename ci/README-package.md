# Packaging (Inno Setup) - Local Guide

This document describes how to create a Windows `setup.exe` locally using the repository's packaging scripts and the `package` CMake target.

Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2026 (VS18) with "Desktop development with C++" workload.
- Inno Setup (`ISCC.exe`) installed (we recommend installing via Chocolatey).
- A developer-local `vcpkg` installation outside the repository, configured via `VCPKG_ROOT` and optionally `VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR` as documented in the root `README.md`.
- Qt via vcpkg (this repo uses `windeployqt` during packaging).

Steps (Visual Studio UI - recommended)
1. Open the repository in Visual Studio (CMake project).
2. Select `Release` configuration.
3. Open the CMake Targets View.
4. Build the `package` target.

What happens
- The `package` target installs the chosen config into `${binaryDir}/staging`.
- The packaging script runs `windeployqt` and then calls Inno Setup to produce an installer under `${binaryDir}/dist`.

Steps (Command line)

```powershell
# Configure + build with presets
cmake --preset app
cmake --build --preset release-app

# Create staging and package
.\ci\package-inno.ps1 -BuildDir .build\app -Config Release -StagingDir .build\app\staging -OutputDir .build\app\dist -Version 0.1.0 -RunWindeployQt
```

Troubleshooting
- If ISCC is not found, ensure Inno Setup is installed and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe` exists.
- If the installer misses DLLs, check `ci\logs\windeployqt-output.txt` and verify Qt was installed by vcpkg.
- Test `staging\bin\fossredder.exe` before building the installer.
- If `cmake --preset app` resolves to the wrong `vcpkg`, verify `VCPKG_ROOT` and `VCPKG_INSTALLED_DIR` in a fresh terminal session first.
